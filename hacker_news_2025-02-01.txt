Content: U.S. and Dutch law enforcement agencies have announced that they have dismantled 39 domains and their associated servers as part of efforts to disrupt a network of online marketplaces originating from Pakistan.  The action, which took place on January 29, 2025, has been codenamed Operation Heart Blocker.  The vast array of sites in question peddled phishing toolkits and fraud-enabling tools and was operated by a group known as Saim Raza since at least 2020, which is also known as HeartSender.   These offerings were then used by transnational organized crime groups to target several victims in the United States as part of various business email compromise ( BEC ) schemes, leading to losses totaling over $3 million.  "The Saim Raza-run websites operated as marketplaces that advertised and facilitated the sale of tools such as phishing kits, scam pages, and email extractors, often used to build and maintain fraud operations," the U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) said .

Content: BeyondTrust has revealed it completed an investigation into a recent cybersecurity incident that targeted some of the company's Remote Support SaaS instances by making use of a compromised API key.  The company said the breach involved 17 Remote Support SaaS customers and that the API key was used to enable unauthorized access by resetting local application passwords. The breach was first flagged on December 5, 2024.  "The investigation determined that a zero-day vulnerability of a third-party application was used to gain access to an online asset in a BeyondTrust AWS account," the company said  this week.  "Access to that asset then allowed the threat actor to obtain an infrastructure API key that could then be leveraged against a separate AWS account which operated Remote Support infrastructure."   The American access management company did not name the application that was explored to obtain the API key, but said the probe uncovered two separate flaws in its...

Content: Meta-owned WhatsApp on Friday said it disrupted a campaign that involved the use of spyware to target journalists and civil society members.  The campaign, which targeted around 90 members, involved the use of spyware from an Israeli company known as Paragon Solutions. The attackers were neutralized in December 2024.  In a statement  to The Guardian, the encrypted messaging app said it has reached out to affected users, stating it had "high confidence" that the users were targeted and "possibly compromised." It's currently not known who is behind the campaign and for how long it took place.   The attack chain is said to be zero-click, meaning the deployment of the spyware occurs without requiring any user interaction. It's suspected to involve the distribution of a specially-crafted PDF file sent to individuals who were added to group chats on WhatsApp.  The company also revealed that it had sent Paragon a "cease and desist" letter and that it was...

Content: Cybersecurity researchers have discovered a malvertising campaign that's targeting Microsoft advertisers with bogus Google ads that aim to take them to phishing pages that are capable of harvesting their credentials.  "These malicious ads, appearing on Google Search, are designed to steal the login information of users trying to access Microsoft's advertising platform," Jérôme Segura, senior director of research at Malwarebytes, said  in a Thursday report.  The findings came a few weeks after the cybersecurity company exposed  a similar campaign that leveraged sponsored Google Ads to target individuals and businesses advertising via the search giant's advertising platform.  The latest set of attacks targets users who search for terms like "Microsoft Ads" on Google Search, hoping to trick them into clicking on malicious links served in the form of sponsored ads in the search results pages.  At the same time, the threat actors behind the campaign employ s...
