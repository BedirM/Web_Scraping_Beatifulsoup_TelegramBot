Content: The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued alerts about the presence of hidden functionality in Contec CMS8000 patient monitors  and Epsimed MN-120 patient monitors.  The vulnerability , tracked as CVE-2025-0626 , carries a CVSS v4 score of 7.7 on a scale of 10.0. The flaw, alongside two other issues, was reported to CISA by an anonymous external researcher.  "The affected product sends out remote access requests to a hard-coded IP address, bypassing existing device network settings to do so," CISA said  in an advisory. "This could serve as a backdoor and lead to a malicious actor being able to upload and overwrite files on the device."   "The reverse backdoor provides automated connectivity to a hard-coded IP address from the Contec CMS8000 devices, allowing the device to download and execute unverified remote files. Publicly available records show that the IP address is not associa...

Title: Top 5 AI-Powered Social Engineering Attacks
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/top-5-ai-powered-social-engineering.html?m=1
Content: Social engineering has long been an effective tactic because of how it focuses on human vulnerabilities. There's no brute-force 'spray and pray' password guessing. No scouring systems for unpatched software. Instead, it simply relies on manipulating emotions such as trust, fear, and respect for authority, usually with the goal of gaining access to sensitive information or protected systems.  Traditionally that meant researching and manually engaging individual targets, which took up time and resources. However, the advent of AI has now made it possible to launch social engineering attacks  in different ways, at scale, and often without psychological expertise. This article will cover five ways that AI is powering a new wave of social engineering attacks.  The audio deepfake that may have influenced Slovakia elections  Ahead of Slovakian parliamentary elections in 2023, a recording emerged that appeared to feature candidate Michal Simecka in conversation with a well-known journalist, M...

Content: Italy's data protection watchdog has blocked  Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) firm DeepSeek's service within the country, citing a lack of information on its use of users' personal data.  The development comes days after the authority, the Garante, sent a series of questions  to DeepSeek, asking about its data handling practices and where it obtained its training data.  In particular, it wanted to know what personal data is collected by its web platform and mobile app, from which sources, for what purposes, on what legal basis, and whether it is stored in China.  In a statement issued January 30, 2025, the Garante said it arrived at the decision after DeepSeek provided information that it said was "completely insufficient."  The entities behind the service, Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, and Beijing DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence, have "declared that they do not operate in Italy and that European legislation does not apply to them," i...

Content: Google said it blocked over 2.36 million policy-violating Android apps from being published to the Google Play app marketplace in 2024 and banned more than 158,000 bad developer accounts that attempted to publish such harmful apps.  The tech giant also noted it prevented 1.3 million apps from getting excessive or unnecessary access to sensitive user data during the time period by working with third-party app developers.  Furthermore, Google Play Protect, a security feature  that's enabled by default on Android devices to flag novel threats, identified 13 million new malicious apps from outside of the official app store.  "As a result of partnering closely with developers, over 91% of app installs on the Google Play Store now use the latest protections of Android 13 or newer," Bethel Otuteye and Khawaja Shams from the Android Security and Privacy Team, and Ron Aquino from Google Play Trust and Safety said .  In comparison, the company blocked 1.43 million  and 2.28 millio...

Title: Lightning AI Studio Vulnerability Could've Allowed RCE via Hidden URL Parameter
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2025/01/lightning-ai-studio-vulnerability.html?m=1
Content: Cybersecurity researchers have disclosed a critical security flaw in the Lightning AI Studio  development platform that, if successfully exploited, could have allowed for remote code execution.  The vulnerability, rated a CVSS score of 9.4, enables "attackers to potentially execute arbitrary commands with root privileges" by exploiting a hidden URL parameter, application security firm Noma said  in a report shared with The Hacker News.  "This level of access could hypothetically be leveraged for a range of malicious activities, including the extraction of sensitive keys from targeted accounts," researchers Sasi Levi, Alon Tron, and Gal Moyal said.  The issue is embedded in a piece of JavaScript code that could facilitate unfettered access to a victim's development environment, as well as run arbitrary commands on an authenticated target in a privileged context.  Noma said it found a hidden parameter called "command" in user-specific URLs – e.g., ...
